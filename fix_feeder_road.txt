MANUAL FIX REQUIRED:

In file: frontend/views/FillFormView.tsx
Line 64 needs to be changed FROM:

!['74', '83', '87', '88', '101', '132', '69', '99', '67', '89'].includes(indicatorId)

TO:

!['74', '83', '87', '88', '101', '132', '69', '99', '67', '89', '43'].includes(indicatorId)

This will add indicator '43' (Nyuruvumu Gahushyi-Gituku feeder road) to the percentage-only list.
