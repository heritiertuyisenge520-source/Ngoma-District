===================================
to calculate progress
==================================


for many indicators formula is the same
because the data and calculation is cumulative


so. 
there are some indicators that has like sub indicators.
and there is another that are in percentage instead of number
there is also another that are in rate. so that all i will tell how we are going to treat it


but to other indicator 

to calculate the progress of month like july:
we took input values divide  fixed target in quater one times 100 to put it on percentage 
because we are still in quater one if we reach in august: 
you took input of august divite the fixed target of quarer 1 times 100 to put it in percentage
and do that in september.
 it means if the user is reporting the data is reporte as cumulative dont worry that means the progress of september is the progress of the whole quater


 if we reach on quater 2 to calculate the progress of october
 we took input value of october divide the fixed target of quater 1+ quaater 2 times 100 
 on november also is to take input in november divide the fixed target of quater 1+ quaater 2 times 100 
 and so on december wetook input in december divide the fixed target of quater 1+ quaater 2 times 100 and that progress be the progress of whole quater

 on quater 3 
 on january we took input in january divide the fixed target of quater 1+ quaater 2+ quater 3 times 100.
 on february we took input in february divide fixed target of quater 1+ quaater 2+ quater 3 times 100.
 on march we took input in march divide fixed target of quater 1+ quaater 2+ quater 3 times 100
 and become the progress of the quater 3

 on april 
 we took input in april divide fixed target of quater + quater 2+ quater 3 + quater 4 times 100
 on may
 we took input in may divide fixed target of quater + quater 2+ quater 3 + quater 4 times 100
 on june
 we took input in june divide fixed target of quater1 + quater 2+ quater 3 + quater 4 times 100
 and become the progress of the quater 4


==================================
annualy

we need to calculate the progress of every month at anuual level

 we take like input in july divite wth fixed target of annual level(annula level is the sum of fixed target of the quaters).

 that all is the indicators that is not in percentages.



 so there is another indicators that user will put number in percentages so that indicators is treade different to get the progress.


 example:

on all indicators that is in percentage the user is asked like 
put the target population you are targeting to pay the health insurance : 10000
put the number of pupulation pay insurance : 2000

to report percentage that we are going to use to find progress we took (2000/10000)*100 = 20%
so that 20% is going to be used to calculate the progress of the month. so it means if the fixed target in quarter 1 is 40% it means to calculate the progress of july you took result from calculaion from like target and anchievement as an input divite fixed target of quater 1 times 100.
so it means the answer is going to be 20/40*100 = 50% as progress of july. 
for august if the input of target is 5000 and achievemnt be 4000 it means the percentage as input we re going to use is 4000/5000*100 = 80%. so we took that 80% /40% as fixed target of quater 1 to calculate the progress of august. s it will be (80/40)*100 = 200% as progress of august.
and on september it means the input is 6000 and achievemnt is 5000. so the percentage is 5000/6000*100 = 83.3% as input for september and progress is equal to (83.3/40)*100 = 208.5%.

so another thing to conssider is on quater wwe dont add the percentages of the quaters for calculate in other quaters as we did it on numbers.

so there is another stuff of percentage where they come and put only the percentages like 40 % without adding target and achiievement so it means to calculate the progress of every monht is to take the input of it divide the fixed target times 100.

so there is nother type of percentages where look imprvemenst but is decreasiing like number of dropout so let take fixed target at quater 1  20% so on july put 50% it means the pr0gress 20/50*100 = 40% as progress of july.
august input is 30% and progress  20/30*100 = 60% as progress of august.
september input is 20% and progress 20/20*100 = 100% as progress of september. and so on





for the indicator that has the merged indicator inside 
  we will first track the progress of the merged indicator inside from monthly to quaterly to yearly on percentage 
  after to  for the main indicator you make average of percentange from that merged indicator monthly quaterly annually and also find where you are going 

and also display the fixed target where is necessary


so, for the indicator that has the merged indicator inside 
  we
