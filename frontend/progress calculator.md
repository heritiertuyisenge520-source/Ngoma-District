- Area 3 compliance: 48%

**Sub-Indicator Progress Calculations:**

**Area 1 (Indicator 45a1):**
- Monthly achievements: Jan: 20%, Feb: 30%, Mar: 40%, Apr: 45%, May: 45%, Jun: 45%
- June Progress: 45 × 100 / 50 = 90.00%

**Area 2 (Indicator 45a2):**
- Monthly achievements: Jan: 30%, Feb: 40%, Mar: 50%, Apr: 55%, May: 55%, Jun: 55%
- June Progress: 55 × 100 / 50 = 110.00% → capped at 100%

**Area 3 (Indicator 45a3):**
- Monthly achievements: Jan: 25%, Feb: 35%, Mar: 45%, Apr: 48%, May: 48%, Jun: 48%
- June Progress: 48 × 100 / 50 = 96.00%

**Composite Progress Calculation:**
1. Calculate average of sub-indicator achievements: (45 + 55 + 48) / 3 = 49.33%
2. Use this average as the parent indicator achievement
3. Calculate parent progress: 49.33 × 100 / 50 = 98.66%

**Monthly Composite Progress:**
- January: (20 + 30 + 25) / 3 = 25% → 25 × 100 / 50 = 50.00%
- February: (30 + 40 + 35) / 3 = 35% → 35 × 100 / 50 = 70.00%
- March: (40 + 50 + 45) / 3 = 45% → 45 × 100 / 50 = 90.00%
- April: (45 + 55 + 48) / 3 = 49.33% → 49.33 × 100 / 50 = 98.66%
- May: (45 + 55 + 48) / 3 = 49.33% → 98.66% (same as April)
- June: (45 + 55 + 48) / 3 = 49.33% → 98.66% (final)

**Quarterly Composite Progress:**
- Q1: Average of Jan-Mar achievements = (25+35+45)/3 = 35% → 35 × 100 / 50 = 70.00%
- Q2: Average of Apr-Jun achievements = (49.33+49.33+49.33)/3 = 49.33% → 98.66%

**Annual Composite Progress:**
- Annual average achievement: 49.33% × 100 / 50 = 98.66%

**Special Notes for Composite Fixed Percentage Indicators:**
- Calculate each sub-indicator's achievement separately
- Take the average of all sub-indicator achievements
- Use this average as the parent indicator's achievement
- Apply the same fixed percentage calculation: average_achievement × 100 / fixed_target
- This ensures balanced contribution from all sub-areas

- All quarters use 27% target since Q2-Q4 have 0 targets
- Q1: 27 × 100 / 25 = 108.00% → 100% (using September achievement)
- Q2-Q4: 100% (achievement below target)

**Annual Progress:**
- 27 × 100 / 2 = 1,350.00% → 100%

**Special Notes:**
- Decreasing indicators invert the calculation: lower achievement = higher progress
- Target is 27% repetition rate, so lower actual rates show better performance
- Progress is capped at 100% even when achievement is much better than target

- Q4: 4.9 × 100 / 2.4 = 204.17% → 100% (using June achievement)

**Annual Progress:**
- 4.9 × 100 / 2.4 = 204.17% → 100%

**Detailed Explanation of Decreasing Percentage Calculation:**
1. **Target Interpretation**: 4.9% dropout rate is the target (lower is better)
2. **Achievement Interpretation**: Actual dropout rates (6.5% in July, decreasing to 2.4% in June)
3. **Formula**: Progress = (Target / Achievement) × 100
4. **Logic**: As actual dropout rate decreases (improves), progress increases
5. **Capping**: Progress cannot exceed 100% (capped when achievement < target)

**Progress vs Achievement Relationship:**
| Month     | Actual Dropout Rate | Target | Calculation | Progress |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| July      | 6.5% (high)         | 4.9%   | 4.9/6.5×100 | 75.38%   |
| September | 5.2% (improving)    | 4.9%   | 4.9/5.2×100 | 94.23%   |
| December  | 4.2% (better)       | 4.9%   | 4.9/4.2×100 | 100%     |
| March     | 3.3% (good)         | 4.9%   | 4.9/3.3×100 | 100%     |
| June      | 2.4% (excellent)    | 4.9%   | 4.9/2.4×100 | 100%     |

**Special Notes for Decreasing Indicators:**
- **Inverted Calculation**: Denominator and numerator are swapped compared to standard indicators
- **Lower is Better**: Lower actual values indicate better performance
- **Performance Capping**: Maximum progress is always 100%
- **Target Interpretation**: The target represents the maximum acceptable value
- **Progress Interpretation**: Shows how close actual performance is to the target (lower = better)

**Real-world Interpretation:**
- July: 75.38% progress means actual dropout rate (6.5%) is worse than target (4.9%)
- December: 100% progress means actual dropout rate (4.2%) meets or exceeds target (4.9%)
- June: 100% progress means excellent performance (2.4% dropout rate vs 4.9% target)

### Indicator 69: Percentage of people screened positive to Hypertension and Diabetes enrolled into care and treatment (Composite)
**Category:** Composite Percentage Indicator
**Measurement Type:** percentage
**Sub-Indicators:**
- hypertension (69a), diabetes (69b)

**Targets:**
- Q1: 20% | Q2: 40% | Q3: 60% | Q4: 80% | Annual: 80%

**Fake Data Example (June 2026):**
- Hypertension screening: 75% enrolled
- Diabetes screening: 68% enrolled

**Sub-Indicator Progress Calculations:**

**Hypertension (Indicator 69a):**
- Targets: Q1: 20% | Q2: 40% | Q3: 60% | Q4: 80% | Annual: 80%
- Annual Progress: 75 × 100 / 80 = 93.75%

**Diabetes (Indicator 69b):**
- Targets: Q1: 20% | Q2: 40% | Q3: 60% | Q4: 80% | Annual: 80%
- Annual Progress: 68 × 100 / 80 = 85.00%

**Composite Progress Calculation:**
- Average of sub-indicator progresses: (93.75 + 85.00) / 2 = 89.38%

**Special Notes:**
- Each sub-indicator follows increasing percentage calculation rules
- Parent progress is the average of both sub-indicator percentages
- Both sub-indicators share the same target structure

## Calculation Methodology Summary

### Standard Numeric Indicators
- **Monthly:** achievement × 100 / cumulative_target_up_to_current_quarter
- **Quarterly:** quarter_achievement × 100 / cumulative_target_for_quarter
- **Annual:** total_achievement × 100 / annual_target

### Percentage Indicators (Increasing)
- **Monthly:** achievement × 100 / current_quarter_target
- **Quarterly:** quarter_achievement × 100 / current_quarter_target
- **Annual:** total_achievement × 100 / annual_target

### Percentage Indicators (Fixed)
- **All periods:** achievement × 100 / fixed_target

### Percentage Indicators (Decreasing)
- **All periods:** target × 100 / achievement (inverted calculation)

### Composite Indicators
- Calculate each sub-indicator separately
- Parent progress = average of all sub-indicator progresses
