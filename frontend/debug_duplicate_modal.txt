DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS FOR FillFormView.tsx
==========================================

1. FIND THIS LINE in FillFormView.tsx (around line 606):
   {showDuplicateModal && existingSubmission && (

2. REPLACE IT WITH:
   {showDuplicateModal && existingSubmission && (
     <>
       {/* DEBUG: Show what we received */}
       <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 border-b">
         <p className="text-xs font-mono">DEBUG: existingSubmission = {JSON.stringify(existingSubmission, null, 2)}</p>
       </div>

3. FIND THE CLOSING OF THE MODAL (should be around line 790):
   )}

4. REPLACE IT WITH:
   </>
   )}

This will show you exactly what data is in the existingSubmission object when the modal opens.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Does "subValues" exist in the debug output?
- Is "subValues" an empty object {} or does it have data?
- What's the structure of the existingSubmission?

EXPECTED OUTPUT FOR SUB-INDICATORS:
{
  "_id": "...",
  "indicatorName": "MAIZE (HA)",
  "subValues": {
    "maize": "100",
    "beans": "50"
  },
  ...
}

EXPECTED OUTPUT FOR SINGLE INDICATOR:
{
  "_id": "...", 
  "indicatorName": "Some Indicator",
  "value": 75,
  "subValues": undefined,
  ...
}

If subValues is missing or empty, that's why you're seeing the single value input!
